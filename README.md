freeCodeCamp JavaScript LESSON: building a RPG
---
Disclaimer:
Unlike my previous freeCodeCamp github repos, this is directly a FreeCodeCamp lesson.<br>
A freeCodeCamp Project offers a loose guideline and list of checks of what the learner should build, but leaves the actual programming to the learner<br>
A freeCodeCamp lesson is a railroaded coding session rather then an independent project, with a series of strict ordered checks (173 in this case) to ensure you are writing the code expected in order to learn the topic.<br>
As such I take no credit for the contents of this lesson.<br>
I am adding it to my repository as it is a good showcase of combining HTML, CSS and Javascript and I may want to revist this file in my free time as a reference on how to link various javaScript code to HTML.<br>
